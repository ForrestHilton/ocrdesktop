Needs experimenting or info

- it is possible to identify a open menu? so we could set a OCR area insteed screenshotting the window. 
this will leed to more readable results in menus. if not maybe we could  range pixels left/right of the cursor and let the user select via entry window
check the common Menue sizes

- do we know object is have under the cursor? No Chance via API but:
  We could guess! :)
  I think we could not be shure here but we could expect some things that happens verry often.
  Hopfully this list will raise and it gives usefull information.
  for example:
  First line is window title
  second line is window menu
  X end of the first or second line is close button
  D end of the first or second line is fullscreenbutton
  QT is a Selected checkbox
  last line is Statusbar
